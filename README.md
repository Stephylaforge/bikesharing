## Analysis
Based on the data from the NYC CitiBike file we are able to filter and create a story off the bike rides, user information, location, and more. By using the data from the CitiBike NYC file we can create a story that will convince the investors in Des-Moines that bike-sharing program is a good proposal. 


## Deliverable 1
The first step was to dat the August 2019 file from NYC CitiBike and change the "tripduration" column to a datetime format.

### Summary

Based off the results from converting the time duration into a csv file and using the new measurements to find new observations to share for a new bike-sharing project. If you had to present this data to the investor who wants to create a new Bike-sharing business in another city he can find how long people spend on the bikes. The gender which can play a role in who to market too, where to set up the bikes, and any other aspects that can help based off who has the most rides. The weekday data is very important too that can observe the busiest times, places, and hours of the day.
