## Analysis
Based on the data from the NYC CitiBike file we are able to filter and create a story off the bike rides, user information, location, and more. By using the data from the CitiBike NYC file we can create a story that will convince the investors in Des-Moines that bike-sharing program is a good proposal. 


## Deliverable 1
The first step was to dat the August 2019 file from NYC CitiBike and change the "tripduration" column to a datetime format.
